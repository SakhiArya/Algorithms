/*FROM WIKIPEDIA: Radix sort complexity is O(wn) for n keys which are integers of word size w. 
 * Sometimes w is presented as a constant, which would make radix sort better (for sufficiently large n) 
 * than the best comparison-based sorting algorithms, which all perform O(n log n) comparisons to sort n keys. 
 * However, in general w cannot be considered a constant: if all n keys are distinct, 
 * then w has to be at least log n for a random-access machine to be able to store them in memory, 
 * which gives at best a time complexity O(n log n).
 * [2] That would seem to make radix sort at most equally efficient as the best comparison-based sorts (and worse if keys are much longer than log n).
